										I have been working with Sannkalp Shiksha even before they were registered as an NGO. I am proud to be a part of an organization that is making a difference in the lives of children and their families. The NGO expanded under the guidance of the founders, NIT-H alumni, and through CSR from Tredence. I believe that the future of Sannkalp Shiksha is bright as they continue to focus on their goal of providing education to the underprivileged children. This vision will not only change the lives of the unprivileged children but will also fight child labour rooted deep in our society due to poverty and unemployment.
